## Procedures

### Motive Compliance

* Installers should use the correct cables for each vehicle, as listed in the FSP's Cables tab. Search for cable product IDs on the Motive Help Center for easier identification.
* Report any issues, such as defective equipment, missing cables, or customer no-shows, to your Motive Point of Contact (POC).
* When hardwiring, always try to use a spare circuit if one is available, instead of tapping into an existing circuit.
* Be ready to add an inline fuse to any circuit that isn’t already protected by Motive.
* Follow the installation preferences discussed during the kickoff call.

### Pre-installation

* Turn off the ignition on all vehicles and equipment before starting any installation work.
* Perform a detailed inspection of the vehicle, noting any existing issues such as physical damage (cracked panels, missing screws, broken clips, cracked windshield) or warning lights (e.g., check-engine lights or diagnostic trouble codes).

### Mounting/Securing

* Follow the installation guide and best practices for cable management and device mounting.
* Install Vehicle Gateways with the Motive logo facing up or outward toward the vehicle body. Avoid positioning the logo facing down or under thick metal.
* Avoid placing the Vehicle Gateway under metal components that may interfere with GPS signal strength whenever feasible.
* For in-dash, covert installs, don’t rely solely on vehicle adhesive. Use zip ties to secure the Vehicle Gateway and cables whenever possible.
* Avoid putting excessive stress on Motive cables or their connection points. Use a 6-inch diameter loop and avoid bending cables into a dog-bone shape.
* Ensure solar-powered Asset Gateways have a clear view of the sky.
* Create a drip loop for the Asset Gateway’s cable when necessary to prevent water damage.
* Ensure that Dashcams comply with DOT regulations, do not block the Driver’s view, and are within the windshield wiper’s sweep area.
* Position road-facing cameras so Drivers can see the hood and mirrors, with the horizon near the center of the camera’s vertical view.
* Position Driver-facing cameras to capture the Driver from the waist up, with minimal obstructions.
* Clean and dry all surfaces before applying adhesive mounts.
* Before drilling, check for any components behind the drill site to avoid damaging the vehicle.

### Post-Installation

* Verify that the equipment is installed properly by checking the LED lights and installation apps.
* Make sure the vehicle is returned in the same condition it was in before installation.
* Do not unplug the device or turn off the vehicle during setup or firmware updates. (See _Vehicle Gateway LED lights are Blinking Orange and Green_).
